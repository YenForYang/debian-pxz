Description: parallel LZMA compressor using liblzma
 Parallel XZ is a compression utility that takes advantage of running LZMA
 compression of different parts of an input file on multiple cores and
 processors simultaneously. Its primary goal is to utilize all resources to
 speed up compression time with minimal possible influence on compression
 ratio.
